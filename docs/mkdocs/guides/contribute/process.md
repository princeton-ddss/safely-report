# Contribution Process

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to Safely Report!
We believe that it is the community that makes an open source project truly great
and successful, so we welcome contribution from any new members.

To contribute to Safely Report, you can take steps below.

## 1. Open an Issue

First, check existing issues [here](https://github.com/princeton-ddss/safely-report/issues)
to see if any of them already addresses your concern. If none, open a new one with
as much detail about your issue as possible.

## 2. Triage the Issue

Once a new issue is opened, Safely Report's core development team will be in touch through
replies in the issue ticket. The main purpose of this interaction is to clarify and flesh out
any missing details about the issue so that the ticket can be turned into a concrete action plan
with clearer scope and priority. You will also collaborate with the core development team to decide
stakeholders for the issue resolution, such as implementation owner and reviewers/approvers.

## 3. Implement the Solution

Unless the issue resolution requires deeper expertise or larger scope (e.g., architectural change),
you will be highly encouraged to be the implementation owner. If so, you can follow instructions
[here](setup.md) to start your development.
